## What Is Twitter Data?

Twitter data is the information collected by either the user, the access point, what’s in the post and how users view or use your post. While this might sound somewhat vague, it’s largely due to the massive amount of data that can be collected from a single Tweet.

With this information, you can know demographics, total clicks on your profile or how many people saw your Tweet. This is just the tip of the iceberg, but understanding the data allows you to know how it’s used and the patterns of your content.
